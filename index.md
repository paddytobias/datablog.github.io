## My blog

Inspired by [this article](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/), I have decided to join the Millenials and write a blog... about discovering data science. It is based on my GitHub repository so I can easy share the code that I've written. 

I am keen to get better at forming arguments and writing short, interesting pieces around numbers. 

## About me
I am currently undertaking a Masters of Data Science. I have been at the University of New England (Armidale, NSW) for 8 years, having completed my PhD in political science, and now work as the University's eResearch Analyst for a Sydney-based group called [Intersect Australia](https://intersect.org.au). My bachelors was in International Relations. I've had a mixed professional history to say the least.

The potentials of programming and computational methods is certainly exciting. I am relatively new to it and mostly self-taught. My main interests are in interrogating text-based data through programmatic means - traditional natural language processing does not do this very well I don't think. I mostly use **R**, some **SQL** and **new** to Python. 

I'm hoping this blog will help me navigate the mysterious world of data science.
