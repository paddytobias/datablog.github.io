## Data Blog

I am currently undertaking a Masters of Data Science. I have been at the University of New England (Armidale, NSW) for 8 years, having completed my PhD in political science, and now work as the University's eResearch Analyst for a Sydney-based group called [Intersect Australia](https://intersect.org.au).

The potentials of programming and computational methods is exciting and I am particularly interested in interrogating text data through programmatic means. I mostly use **R**, a bit of **SQL** and **some** Python. 

This blog will track my way through data science.
